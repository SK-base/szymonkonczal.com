Vercel is built for Next.js. Connect your repo, set env vars, and get previews per branch. Static pages are served from the edge; server code runs in serverless functions.

## Build and Output

Use the default build; Vercel detects Next.js. For static export, set `output: 'export'` in next.config. Otherwise you get hybrid static and dynamic routes.
