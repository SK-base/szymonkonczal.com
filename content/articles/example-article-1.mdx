This is an example article demonstrating how to build a modern personal blog using Next.js, MDX, and Tailwind CSS.

## Introduction

Personal blogs are making a comeback. In an age of social media algorithms and content platforms, having your own space on the web is more valuable than ever.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides excellent tooling for building static sites:

- **Static Site Generation**: Pre-render pages at build time
- **MDX Support**: Write content in Markdown with React components
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization
- **Great DX**: Excellent developer experience

## Setting Up the Project

First, create a new Next.js project:

\`\`\`bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-blog --typescript --tailwind --app
\`\`\`

Then install the necessary dependencies for MDX processing.

## Content Management

Organize your content in a `content/` directory:

- Notes: Short, frequent posts
- Articles: Longer, evergreen pieces
- Projects: Portfolio items

Each content type can have its own structure and metadata.

## Customization

One of the benefits of building your own blog is the ability to customize everything. You can:

- Create custom layouts for specific articles
- Add interactive components
- Style everything exactly how you want

## Conclusion

Building your own blog gives you complete control over your content and presentation. While it requires more effort than using a platform, the benefits are worth it.
