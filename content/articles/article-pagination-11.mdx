Use a `status` field in frontmatter: DRAFT or PUBLISHED. In production builds, filter to only PUBLISHED so drafts never ship. In development, show everything so you can preview drafts.

## Implementation

Check `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` in your content loaders. When true, exclude items with `status: 'DRAFT'`. Single-page fetches (e.g. by slug) should return null for drafts in production so those URLs 404.
