RSS lets readers subscribe to your blog. Expose an XML feed with recent posts (e.g. `/feed.xml`). Include title, link, description, and pubDate for each item.

## Generating the Feed

In Next.js, create a Route Handler that returns `Content-Type: application/xml` and build the XML from your content. Use a library like `rss` or build the string manually.
