Server Components run only on the server. They reduce client bundle size and can fetch data directly. No `useState` or `useEffect`—they're not interactive by default.

## Why Server Components?

- **Smaller bundles**: Only client components and their dependencies ship to the browser.
- **Direct data access**: No need for API routes for internal data.
- **Security**: Keep secrets on the server; they never reach the client.

## When to Use Client Components

Use `"use client"` when you need interactivity: event handlers, hooks, or browser APIs. Compose server and client components freely.
