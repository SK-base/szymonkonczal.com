Use `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>` to give structure. Screen readers and assistive tech rely on landmarks. Buttons for actions, links for navigation—don't swap them.

## ARIA When Necessary

Prefer native HTML. Use ARIA when semantics aren't enough: `aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, `role` for custom widgets. Test with a screen reader occasionally.
