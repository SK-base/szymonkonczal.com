This article is rendered by a **custom React component** instead of the default MDX template. It demonstrates how you can build unique layouts with your own React elements.

## Why Custom Layouts?

Sometimes a standard blog post layout isn't enough. You might want:

- A hero section with a distinct visual style
- Callout boxes or key takeaways
- Custom typography and spacing for a specific piece
- Interactive elements or embedded media

## How It Works

The custom component lives in `articles/[slug]/index.tsx` and is registered in `lib/article-components.ts`. When the article page loads, it checks for a custom component for that slug and uses it instead of the default MDX renderer.

You still write content in MDX; the custom component fetches the article via `getArticleBySlug(slug)` and can render the body with `<MDXContent source={article.content} />` or compose it with custom sections.

## Wrapping Up

Custom layouts give you full control over structure and design while keeping your content in Markdown. This page is one example—you can build anything that fits your article.
