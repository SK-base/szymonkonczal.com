Vitest is a Jest-compatible test runner that integrates with Vite. Fast, ESM-native, and minimal config. Use `describe`, `it`, `expect` as you would with Jest.

## Running Tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

Use `vi.mock()` for mocks and `vi.spyOn()` for spies. Vitest runs in Node by default; configure `environment: "jsdom"` if you need DOM APIs.
