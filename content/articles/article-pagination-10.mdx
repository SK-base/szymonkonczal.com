Run typecheck, lint, and tests on every push or PR. Use a workflow that installs deps, runs checks, and optionally deploys. Store secrets in GitHub and pass them to Vercel or other providers.

## Example Steps

Checkout, setup Node/pnpm, install, run `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`. Then deploy only on main if all pass.
