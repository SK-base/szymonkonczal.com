pnpm uses a content-addressable store and symlinks so dependencies are shared across projects. Install is fast and disk usage is low. Lockfile is strict by default.

## Commands

`pnpm install`, `pnpm add`, `pnpm run` work like npm. Use `pnpm exec` to run binaries from dependencies. Workspaces are supported for monorepos.
