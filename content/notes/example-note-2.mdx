Typography is one of the most important aspects of web design. Good typography makes content readable and enjoyable.

## Font Pairing

Pairing serif and sans-serif fonts can create visual hierarchy. For example:
- **Serif fonts** (like Playfair Display) work well for headings
- **Sans-serif fonts** (like Manrope) are great for body text

## Readability

Keep line height around 1.5-1.6 for optimal readability. Don't make lines too long—aim for 50-75 characters per line.
